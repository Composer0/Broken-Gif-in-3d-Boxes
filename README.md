### Broken-Gif-in-3d-Boxes
Broken Gif displayed in 16 3d boxes. JavaScript event listener moves the boxes to form a solid image.

Boxes are generated using JavaScript for loop with two indexes. i index used to help establish how many items are to be created for each row with the j index with the original loop being used to establish the additional rows. This relies on the use of CSS Flexbox to establish how many boxes can fit in each row as the initial image is set to 500px in both height and width.

The btn uses an event listener of click to determine when the css animations occurs.

Note: In the JavaScript file you may also note that I added additional features to the 'switcher' function, this was done primarily for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of how I could affect both HTML and CSS through JavaScript.
